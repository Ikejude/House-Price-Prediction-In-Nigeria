# House-Price-Prediction-In-Nigeria

This project aims to predict house prices in Nigeria using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features and characteristics of houses, we can build a model that predicts the price of a house based on its attributes. This can be useful for real estate professionals, homeowners, or anyone interested in estimating house prices accurately.

## About

The House Price Prediction project utilizes machine learning algorithms to create a predictive model for estimating house prices. By analyzing a dataset consisting of historical house prices and their associated features, the project aims to build a reliable model capable of accurately predicting house prices for new instances.

The project implements various machine learning techniques, such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. The code and documentation provide a clear understanding of the process and allow users to replicate or extend the project according to their requirements.

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset containing historical house prices and related attributes. The dataset consists of features bedrooms, bathrooms, toilets, title, town, and state. Each house in the dataset has an associated price, which serves as the target variable for prediction.
The dataset is included in this repository.

## Installation

1. To run the House Price Prediction project locally, follow these steps:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/House-Price-Prediction-In-Nigeria.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd House-Price-Prediction-In_Nigeria
3. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
It is recommended to set up a virtual environment before installing the dependencies.
4. [Optional] If you have the dataset, place it in the data directory.

## Usage

1. Open the project in your preferred development environment or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Navigate to the notebooks directory.
3. Open the house_pred.ipynb notebook.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.
5. Deploy model using FastAPI. The files are included for execution.
You can modify the notebook or add your own code to experiment with different techniques and improve the model's performance.
